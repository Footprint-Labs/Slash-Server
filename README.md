## Introduction 
**/server** is an aggregation platform for building websites from distributed sources and programming languages.  The idea was inspired by OpenSocial, specifically the gadget container where gadgets are aggregated and put together on a single page.  However unlike most OpenSocial containers, /server aggregates the content server side rather than in the browser.  We can do this because we make the assumption all the content providers come from a trusted source a luxury most OpenSocial containers can't make.
